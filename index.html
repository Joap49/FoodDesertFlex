    <h2>What are food deserts?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="text-box">
    <p>"Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers." -American Nutrition Association. Many communities do not have access to fresh or organic foods. Too many people live closer to a McDonald's than a supermarket. Communities which are economically disadvantaged feel the effects of lack of supermarket and fresh foods far more than more privileged communities.</p>
